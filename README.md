- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dennys Choy 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m software developer. I worked with C#, .Net, PHP(CodeIgniter) and most recently, I started working with PEGA Systems(Low-Code app development). 
      I like to coding, that's why I'm trying to do my own projects.
      I'm currently learning ReactJS.
      I'm on my way to became a Fullstack developer working with Javascript.
